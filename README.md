## Introduction

Welcome to EPL PLAY! EPL PLAY is a website-based quiz game designed to test users' knowledge of the English Premier League. Whether you're a die-hard fan or just getting started, this game will challenge your understanding of Premier League history, teams, players, and memorable moments.

## Design

### **Design Choices**
The game was designed to stimulate users' senses. I wanted users to have a sense of being present at a football field while playing the quize. As such, a football field background image was inserted on every pages of the website.

### **Colour**
For the colour, I opted for purple as the only color for the website. This keeps the website clean and simple.

### **Fonts**
Roboto was used for the logo and the headings throughout the site. The logic behind this was to maintain style and simplicity throughout the site and call attention to key information.
Source-sans-pro was chosen for the body text of the website, this font combines very well with Roboto and again maintains the clean simplistic approach site-wide.

### **Structure**
The website consists of four separate pages, all of which are resonsive in nature across all devices.
- A homepage with an introductory message that introduces the users with what the website is all about. It also introduces the quiz".
- An about page that tells users of what EPL Play is about and then goes on to give a brief history of the English Premier League.
- A proile page that let users create a profile for themselves.
- A contact page with a simple form asking for users' email and name.
