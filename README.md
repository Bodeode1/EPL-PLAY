## Design

### **Design Choices**
The game was designed to stimulate users' senses, aiming to give them a sense of being present at a football field while playing the quiz. As such, a football field background image was inserted on every page of the website.

### **Colour**
For the color scheme, I opted for purple as the primary color throughout the website. This choice helps keep the website clean and simple.

### **Fonts**
I used Segoe UI and Lucida Sans for most of the content on the website, as they provide clarity and readability. Additionally, Courier New was chosen for buttons to give them a distinct style.

### **Structure**
The website consists of four separate pages, all of which are responsive across all devices:

Homepage: This page features an introductory message that introduces users to the website and the quiz. It sets the tone and prepares users for the gaming experience.

About Page: The about page provides information about EPL Play and gives a brief history of the English Premier League. It helps users understand the context and significance of the quiz.

Profile Page: Users can create a profile for themselves on this page, allowing for a personalized experience.

Contact Page: The contact page includes a simple form asking for users' email and name. This allows users to get in touch or provide feedback, fostering communication and interaction.

These design choices aim to create an engaging and visually appealing experience for users playing the Premier League Quiz game, while maintaining a consistent and user-friendly interface.
